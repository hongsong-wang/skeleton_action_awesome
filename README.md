# Modeling Temporal Dynamics and Spatial Configurations of Actions Using Two-Stream Recurrent Neural Networks, CVPR, 2017
This is the first two-stream framework for modeling human temporal dynamics and spatial configurations. The proposed two-stream paradigm has been widely adopted in designing networks for skeleton-based human action recognition in this field.

# Beyond Joints: Learning Representations From Primitive Geometries for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition and Detection, TIP, 2018
This is the first work on multimodal skeleton-based human action recognition. We design three modalities from skeleton data—joints, edge, and surface—and find that a simple late fusion of these three streams can significantly improve performance. The widely adopted three modalities, namely joint, bone, and motion, are derived from our work. The bone modality corresponds to our edge modality, and the implementation of the bone also just uses our released code, available at [https://github.com/hongsong-wang/Beyond-Joints](https://github.com/hongsong-wang/Beyond-Joints)."
